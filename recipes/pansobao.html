    <p> Puerto Rican Pan Sobao: A classic sweet bread, Pan Sobao is a tender, airy delight with a subtle sweetness, hints of vanilla, and a fine, even texture, similar to brioche or challah. Typically shaped into a round or oblong loaf with a smooth, golden-brown crust, it's perfect for slicing and serving as a snack or side bread. Traditionally made with wheat flour, sugar, butter or lard, eggs, vanilla, yeast, salt, and milk, Pan Sobao is often enjoyed for breakfast with café con leche, butter, and jam, or as a snack paired with cheese, cured meats, or fresh fruit. This beloved bread is a staple at family gatherings, holidays, and traditional Puerto Rican celebrations, and while modern recipes may introduce innovative twists, the classic version remains a timeless favorite. </p>

    <li>In a large bowl, stir together flour, salt, and lard or vegetable shortening. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture. Stir in the remaining sugar.</li>

    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
